# dailyplannerhw
in this project i created a Daily planner schedule that saves data in the local storage;
 I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar, scroll down
and i will see timeblocks for standard business hours
i can see the timeblocks for that day
each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
if I click into a timeblock
 I can enter an event if I click the save button for that timeblock
the text for that event is saved in local storage
if I refresh the page
then the saved events persist,
